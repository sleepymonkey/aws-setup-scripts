# note, currently this expects you to have the aws boto python library available
here's an example of installing boto via script:
https://github.com/garnaat/paws/blob/master/ec2_custom_script_server.py


# steps to kick off a series of scripts to build a basic AWS webapp infrastructure:

1.  clone repo into <INSTALL_ROOT>
2.  cd <INSTALL_ROOT>
3.  cp aws-setup-scripts/config/client_configs/configuration_context.template /tmp/aws-config
4.  edit /tmp/aws-config such that the following values are specified:

# your company/application name (e.g. brs)
app_name =
# the region you want to launch in (e.g. us-east-1)
aws_region =
# your access and secret key (e.g. AKIA... and X6.../2e....)
aws_access_key =
aws_secret_key =
# the master password for your mysql RDS instance
db_pwd =
# the IP address of the location from which you will ssh into an ec2 instance
user_home_ip =

5.  export AWS_CONFIG_FILE=/tmp/aws-config
6.  python create_aws_infrastructure.py

make sure to execute this if you're running a virtual env:

source ~/.virtualenvs/boto/bin/activate


# here's what i needed to do to complete a brand new acct

+ create email address for new login (c.stg@gmail.com)
+ create aws acct with that email
+ once setup, login to aws and open IAM console
+ select group link from left menu and create group 'admin'
+ attach policy AdministratorAccess to admin group
+ select user link from left menu and create users
+ add each user to group admin
+ if you want to allow user to sign into aws console, create a password for that user
