# note, currently this expects you to have the aws boto python library available 

# steps to kick off a series of scripts to build a basic AWS webapp infrastructure:

1.  clone repo into <INSTALL_ROOT>
2.  cd <INSTALL_ROOT>
3.  cp aws-setup-scripts/config/client_configs/configuration_context.template /tmp/aws-config
4.  edit /tmp/aws-config such that the following values are specified:

# your company/application name (e.g. brs)
app_name =
# the region you want to launch in (e.g. us-east-1)
aws_region =
# your access and secret key (e.g. AKIA... and X6.../2e....)
aws_access_key = 
aws_secret_key =
# the master password for your mysql RDS instance
db_pwd =
# the IP address of the location from which you will ssh into an ec2 instance
user_home_ip = 

5.  export AWS_CONFIG_FILE=/tmp/aws-config 
6.  python create_aws_infrastructure.py 

make sure to execute this if you're running a virtual env:

source ~/.virtualenvs/boto/bin/activate
