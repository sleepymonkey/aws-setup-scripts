###  NB!  i found these instructions in a dir and i believe these are the steps i followed in order
###  to setup the boto package.  i could be wrong however...


# give yourself the ability to create a virtual env
sudo pip install virtualenv

mkdir ~/.virtualenvs
virtualenv ~/.virtualenvs/boto


# this sets your virtual env
source ~/.virtualenvs/boto/bin/activate

# install boto inside your virtual env.  you will not be able to use boto library if you don't first source the above file
pip install boto

# sourcing the activate file above will put you into the virtual env
# to bang out of the virtual env, type the following:
deactivate
